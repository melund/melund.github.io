about_content: | # Summary adapted from resume.typ
  Senior Engineer specializing in biomechanical modeling, developer Experience & Platform Engineering with 10+ years improving source control, build & release automation, test infrastructure, and documentation for modeling and scientific software.

  Led multi-stage Git platform evolution (Bitbucket/Jira → GitLab → Azure DevOps Server + GitHub) and SVN→Git migration, standardizing branching and onboarding across numerous large repositories. Architected unified Azure Pipelines + GitHub Actions CI/CD reducing release cycle from multi-day manual steps to ~25 minutes end-to-end. Designed Sphinx extensions, pytest plugins, and automated installer pipelines to enhance quality, security, and self-service developer workflows. Strong collaborator across product, infrastructure, and open source communities (Snakemake, conda-forge, Xonsh).

          Automation & extension tooling for the AnyBody Modeling System.
        description: |
          The AnyPyTools package provides a Python interface to automate multibody musculoskeletal model simulations in the AnyBody Modeling System. The main advantage of
          AnyPyTools is that it enables reproducible research for the AnyBody Modeling System,
          and bridges the gap to the whole ecosystem of open source scientific Python packages.

          Workflow management for reproducible and scalable data analyses.
        description: |
          Snakemake is highly used in in the field of bioinformatics, but the system is usefull in all cases 
          where data analysis workflows are involved. The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to 
          create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. 

          My contribution to snakemake was enabling windows support, which involved integration of the commandline systems on windows, and updating the snakemake test system 
          to also handle windows tests. I am currently one of the 8 maintainers of the project.

        description: |
          Xonsh is a modern, full-featured and cross-platform python shell. The language is a superset of Python 3.6+ with additional 
          shell primitives that you are used to from Bash and IPython. It works on all major systems including Linux, OSX, and Windows.
          Xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices.

          It has been a while since I actively contributed, but I have previously I was one of the 
          [core-developers](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/graphs/contributors) when xonsh was getting started, and mostly handled 
          the Windows compatibility aspects.

      When I'm not behind my PC, I am father to two kids. I enjoy cooking and outdoor activities with my family,
      like skiing and working trails in the forest. I spend some of my time helping restoring and sailing an 
      [old wooden sailboat](https://traeskibetbetty.dk/) as part of club in Aalborg, that I helped start.
