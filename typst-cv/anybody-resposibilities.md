My main work is development of our Modeling system, and the underlying musculoskeletal models which are implemented in our own programming/modeling language called AnyScript. This is the biomechanical engineering part, which I also researched at the university. But since I left the Univesity I have also handle all kind of other task, and I act as 'glue' engineer at out company, since we such a small company I have handled all roles. From hardware administration, to to computer security, project management, consulting, strategic planning, sales and marketing to CI/CD on both our local hardaware, and in Azures and GitHubs cloud system.


I am Highly pasonate about developer experience and tooling. All the open source projects that I have contributed to or help maintain in my free time, all revolve around that area. I have constantly explorered new ways to improve te devleper procedures at our company, introducing new tools and technologies over the years, to ensure we used the most modern developer practices, and transition the company to be a modern software developer..  

My main work is develoment of a IDE used for programming/modeling advanced multi-body models. I have worked on both the compiler and definition of our own programming/modeling language, as well as our custom IDE our users work in when creating our models. 


Git: 
administers all hundres of git repositories across multple systems (github, Azure DevOps and self-hosted DevOps servers). Also the Git expert at the company that and migrated the multiple SVN repositories to Git when I started at the company. Teaches new employees how to use git, and has designed the branching strategies we use for internal and external deveopment. 


CI/CD: 
I have introdued CI/CD tooling to our company. Both as local azure pipelines running on our local infrastructure and GitHub actions running both locally and on GitHub hosted runners.  I moved our entire build system to a handfull of CI pipelines and templates, which builds all parts of our software system (c++, documentaiton, python tools), and assembles everything into a installer. 


Installer for our sortware system:
Implemented a new installer for our IDE based InnoSetup to create modern installation experience for our IDE. 



Created the developer community around our software modeling system:
As a product owner of our modeling repository, which I have helped curate a network of users  external contributers and devedevelopers from universities all over the world. This involed maintaing a organization on Github (GitHub.com/anybody) where users can get collaborate on modelling files. It also involved many webcasts on product releases, and  multiple webcast which served the purpose of educating users and developers on how to use our system and tools. Including a self-hosted discord forum where users can interact. 



Developed documentation using Sphinx/markdown. 
Create all multiple software documentations in the Sphinx system, for our the software compiler/IDE, modelling langauage, and repository of models in the sphinx documentation system. This included developing extensions for sphinx, which could generate the vast reference manual for own programming/modelling language (AnyScript). As well ass systax highlighters for the pygments library to support own modelling language.
